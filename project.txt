Business Problem 

In this project we will try to find an optimal location for opening an Indian restaurant in Tokyo, Japan.

Since there are lots of restaurants in Tokyo, we need to detect locations that are not too many restaurants. We would also like to find a restaurant with no Indian restaurant nearby. And we would also like to locate an area with a big enough population to support the business. 

We will use data science to generate a list of most promising neighbourhoods based on the above three criteria. We will clearly show the advantages of each area so that the stakeholders can chose the best final location.

Data 

Based on definition of our problem, factors that will influence our decision are:
	•	number of existing restaurants in the neighbourhood 
	•	number of and distance to Indian restaurants in the neighbourhood, if any
	•	population of the neighbourhood

Following data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information:
	•	centers of candidate areas will be generated algorithmically and approximate addresses of centers of those areas will be obtained using Google Maps API reverse geocoding
	•	number of restaurants and their type and location in every neighbourhood will be obtained using Foursquare API
	•	the population of each neighbourhood will be obtained using the data from the Tokyo government (available on http://www.toukei.metro.tokyo.jp/tnenkan/2017/tn17q3i002.htm)
